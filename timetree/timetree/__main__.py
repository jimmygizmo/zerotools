# "python3 path_to_timetree".
# This helps guide the user to proper usage. There is a small piece
# of similar code in the standard if-__main__ section of the
# module's code in its __init__.py file, for completeness.

# Passing an error message via sys.exit(errmsg) also results in
# an exit code of 1, signaling failure to the shell or caller.
# The error message argument is sent to stderr.
